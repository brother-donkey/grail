          The nav element can be tough nut to crack because it can be used in so
          many ways. We often want it to be invisible on narrow screens, but
          appear on larger ones. Some sites don't need one at all, while others
          like to place breadcrumbs or secondary navigation in this spot. On
          some layouts, it can morph between a horiontal and vertical alignment.
          Phew!
