        <p>
          On sites that can expect code blocks or long strings of unbroken (no
          spaces or word breaks) text, Grail's containers can exceed their
          specified widths. This is not a problem unique to Grail, but one that
          is inherent to many site layouts. This page details a few methods of
          solving that issue.

        <h2>Breaking text</h2>
        <p>
          If you have control over how the text is rendered, we recommend adding
          <code>wbr</code> elements, non-breaking spaces, or using CSS to ensure
          the text wraps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this is not possible, then it might be time to invest in a side
          scrolling container (such as the one used by code blocks and tables on
          this site).

        <h2>Overflow</h2>
        <p>
          Although far from ideal, an easy way of ensuring text wraps (and inner
          scrolling containers scroll) is to set <code>overflow:hidden</code> on
          the parent container that is growing too large. This ensures text
          wraps, but has several downsides. For example, UI elements that are
          intended to go beyond the container (such as a popup menu) may get cut
          off.
