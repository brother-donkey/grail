      <p>
        On site that can expect code blocks or long strings of unbroken (no spaces or word breaks) text, Grail's containers can exceed their specified widths. This is not a problem unique to Grail, but one that is inherent to many site layouts. This page details a few methods of solving that issue.
      </p>
      <h2>Breaking text</h2>
      <p>
        If you have control over how the text is rendered, we recommend adding <code>wbr</code> elements, non-breaking spaces, or using CSS to ensure the text wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this is not possible, then it might be time to invest in a side scrolling container (such as the one used by code blocks and tables on this site).

      <h2>Overflow</h2>
      <p>
          Although far from ideal, an easy way of ensuring text wraps (and inner scrolling containers scroll), is to set overflow:hidden the parent container that is growing to large. This ensure text wraps, but has several downsides - UI elements that are intended to go beyond the container (such as a popup menu) may get cut off, for example.
