      <p>
        The twin layout is intended for displaying side by side content. On
        narrow widths, it is identical to other layouts, but as the screen
        sides, it takes <code>main</code> and <code>aside</code>, then makes
        them equal width.
      </p>
      <h2>When should I use the single layout?</h2>
      <p>
        Use the twin layout only when you have something important to show in
        conjuction with your most important content. Want to show a code editor
        window next to your content? Want display sticky tooltips next to your
        article. This layout <em>might</em> but the place to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that this type of thing may also be better achieved with
        single. It really depends.

      <h2>Just give me the markup!</h2>
      <p>Okay, it's over there ->.</p>
