# Standard Layout Specification

The following applies to layout under the `.html.layout-standard` class.

**On mobile**, all containers except `nav` are stacked. In the case of the `header`, `main`, `aside`, and `footer`, a container's height scales with its content.

> The `nav` element is hidden from view. Consider `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` combined with other rules to display it on mobile.
