        It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating
        whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.It’s said that the
        patterns on its back are related to the stars in the night sky, but the
        details of that relationship remain unclear.Aggron is protective of its
        environment. If its mountain is ravaged by a landslide or a fire, this
        Pokémon will haul topsoil to the area, plant trees, and beautifully
        restore its own territory. Raikou embodies the speed of lightning. The
        roars of this Pokémon send shock waves shuddering through the air and
        shake the ground as if lightning bolts had come crashing down.Treecko is
        cool, calm, and collected—it never panics under any situation. If a
        bigger foe were to glare at this Pokémon, it would glare right back
        without conceding an inch of ground.The smallest of things could cause
        it to lose its temper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress, this
        Pokémon can live a long time. Recordings of Jigglypuff’s strange
        lullabies can be purchased from department stores. These CDs can be
        found near the bedding area.Whether it’s due to a lack of moisture or a
        lack of nutrients, in Alola the mushrooms on Paras don’t grow up quite
        right.Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
        together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed, the more
        powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.
        Vigoroth is simply incapable of remaining still. Even when it tries to
        sleep, the blood in its veins grows agitated, compelling this Pokémon to
        run wild throughout the jungle before it can settle down.Charizard flies
        around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such
        great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery
        breath on any opponent weaker than itself.They will cooperate to steal
        eggs from the nests of bird Pokémon, but fights break out to determine
        which one gets to eat the eggs. Torchic has a place inside its body
        where it keeps its flame. Give it a hug—it will be glowing with warmth.
        This Pokémon is covered all over by a fluffy coat of down.When Golem
        grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long,
        long time have shells green with moss.People say that it fled from its
        enemies by using its small webbed hind feet to swim from island to
        island in Alola.
