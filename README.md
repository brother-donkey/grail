# Grail Site Layouts with CSS

## Standard

The standard is the so-called holy grail layout, is starts, like all layouts as stacked on mobile and then adds a lefthand column on middle widths, then three columns on wider widths.

## Elements

The consistuent elements of a given layout correspond to the semantic elements used on most websites. It's recommended but not required that for proper semantics, you match the classname with the html element (ex. `<main class="main">`). These elements and their corresponding elements are as follows:

- `<html class="html">`
- `<body class="body">`
- `<nav class="nav">`
- `<aside class="aside">`
- `<footer class="footer">`

## Inner containers

It's recommended that you nest inner elements within each of the main elements on the page.

## Principals

1. The same elements and contianers should be used in all layouts. We cannot reason through layout change unless we keep things simple and consistent.
2. Layouts are toggled only by changing the class on the document element (`html`).
3.

## Naming ideas

1. Hotel room layouts | studio | twin/double | triple | full
1. Mattress sizes | full | twin | king
1. No convention | standard | twin | stacked |
